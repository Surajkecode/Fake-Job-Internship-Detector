## 🚀 Features
- Detects fake job postings and internships with high accuracy.
- Utilizes **scikit-learn** and **NLTK** for text analysis.
- Pre-trained ML model (`model.pkl`) and vectorizer (`vectorizer.pkl`).
- User-friendly **Flask** web interface for real-time predictions.
- Supports retraining with new datasets.

## 🛠️ Required Libraries
Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install pandas scikit-learn nltk flask
```

## 📌 Setup & Installation
Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### 1️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate    # On Windows
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Train the Model (Optional)
If you want to retrain the model with new data, run:
```sh
python train_model.py
```
This will generate two files:
- `model.pkl` → Saved Machine Learning model
- `vectorizer.pkl` → Saved text vectorizer

### 4️⃣ Run the Application
To start the **Fake Job Detector** web app:
```sh
python app.py
